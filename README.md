# codeQs

For our final project at Skill Distillery we were divided into teams and given eight days to build an application of our choosing.  My team, which included Jonathan Edwards, Brian Ipock, and myself, decided to create a web application for users to take coding quizzes.  Users are able to take quizzes in several categories, generate quizzes based on questions they have previously answered wrong, view their average score by category, and add new questions to the database.

Technologies Used:

Frontend – AngularJS, HTML5, CSS3, & Bootstrap

Backend –  Spring MVC, Spring REST, JPA, JDBC, SQL
